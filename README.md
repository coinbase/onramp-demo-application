## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coinbase/onramp-demo-application.git
   cd onramp-demo-application
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Obtain the necessary API keys from the [Coinbase Developer Platform Dashboard](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/):

   - **CDP Project ID**: Your public project identifier (found in Projects dashboard)
   - **CDP Secret API Key**: Create from API Keys > Secret API Keys (select Ed25519 format)
   - **CDP API Private Key**: The base64-encoded private key from the API key creation

5. Add your API keys to the `.env.local` file:

   ```bash
   # ==============================================
   # PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (safe to expose)
   # ==============================================

   # CDP Project ID - This is your public project identifier
   # Get from: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id_here"

   # Project Name (optional)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_PROJECT_NAME="Coinbase Ramp Demo"

   # ==============================================
   # PRIVATE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (server-side only)
   # ==============================================

   # CDP Secret API Key Name/ID
   # Get from: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/access/api
   # When creating the key, select "Ed25519" as the signature algorithm (recommended)
   # Format: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   CDP_API_KEY="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"

   # CDP API Private Key (Ed25519 format - recommended)
   # Copy the base64-encoded key from CDP Portal
   # Format: A long base64 string ending with "=="
   CDP_API_SECRET="your-base64-encoded-ed25519-private-key-here=="

   # ==============================================
   # OPTIONAL
   # ==============================================

   # CORS Origins - Comma-separated list of allowed origins
   # Add your production domain(s) here for Apple Pay and custom integrations
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001,https://yourdomain.com"

   # Node environment
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

   > **IMPORTANT**: Never commit your API keys to the repository. The `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure.

6. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Security Requirements (Coinbase CDP)

This demo implements **required security measures** as specified by Coinbase Developer Platform:

### CORS Protection (Required)

All session token API endpoints implement CORS headers to prevent unauthorized access:

- ✅ Only allows requests from approved origins
- ✅ Rejects requests from unauthorized domains  
- ✅ Prevents malicious websites from hijacking your API

**Configuration:**

The API endpoints (`/api/session` and `/api/fund/session`) automatically:
- Allow `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001` for development
- Check the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable for production domains

**For Production:** The following domains are configured by default:
- `https://onramp-demo-application-git-main-coinbase-vercel.vercel.app`
- `https://www.onrampdemo.com`

To add additional domains, set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:
```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"
```

### Rate Limiting (Implemented)

- ✅ 10 requests per minute for `/api/session`
- ✅ 20 requests per minute for `/api/fund/session`
- ✅ Per-IP tracking to prevent abuse

### Input Validation (Implemented)

- ✅ Zod schema validation on all inputs
- ✅ Address format validation
- ✅ Blockchain network validation

### Secure Logging (Implemented)

- ✅ No sensitive data (API keys, tokens) in logs
- ✅ Structured logging for security events
- ✅ Request tracking for audit purposes

**⚠️ Important:** These security measures are **required** by Coinbase to prevent unauthorized usage of onramp sessions. Failure to implement these measures may result in unauthorized access to your integration.

For more information, see: [Coinbase Security Requirements](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp/docs/security-requirements)

## Secure Initialization (Session Tokens)

This demo now supports secure initialization using session tokens, which provides enhanced security for onramp and offramp transactions.

### What are Session Tokens?

Session tokens are short-lived, one-time-use tokens that authenticate users and manage sessions securely. When enabled, the application generates a session token server-side before initiating the onramp/offramp flow.

### Benefits of Using Session Tokens

- **Enhanced Security**: API credentials are never exposed to the client
- **Better Control**: Server-side validation before initiating transactions
- **Compliance**: Meets security requirements for production applications

### How to Enable Secure Initialization

1. **Set up CDP API Credentials**: Add your CDP API key and secret to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   CDP_API_KEY="your_cdp_api_key"
   CDP_API_SECRET="your_cdp_api_secret"
   ```

2. **Toggle Secure Initialization**: In both the Onramp and Offramp features, you'll find a "Use Secure Initialization" checkbox. Enable it to use session tokens.

3. **Implementation Example**:
   ```typescript
   // Generate a session token
   const response = await fetch('/api/session', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       addresses: [{
         address: "0x...",
         blockchains: ["ethereum", "base"]
       }],
       assets: ["ETH", "USDC"]
     }),
   });
   
   const { token } = await response.json();
   
   // Use the token in your onramp URL
   const url = generateOnrampURL({
     sessionToken: token,
     // other optional UI params...
   });
   ```

### Important Notes

- Session tokens expire quickly and can only be used once
- When using session tokens, you don't need to pass `appId`, `addresses`, or `assets` in the URL
- The secure initialization option is available in both Onramp and Offramp features

## Integration Options

### Fund Card

The Fund Card provides a pre-built UI component from Coinbase that handles the entire on-ramp process with minimal configuration.

#### Troubleshooting FundCard Issues

If you're experiencing issues with the FundCard component:

1. **400 Bad Request Error**:

   - Ensure your CDP Project ID is correctly set in the `.env.local` file as both `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_PROJECT_ID` and `CDP_PROJECT_ID`
   - Verify that your OnchainKit API Key is valid and active
   - Check that your wallet is connected to the correct network (Base is recommended)
   - Look for detailed error messages in the browser console

2. **Wallet Connection Issues**:

   - Make sure your WalletConnect Project ID is correctly set
   - Try disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet
   - Ensure you're using a compatible wallet (Coinbase Wallet is recommended)

3. **Testing with Simplified Components**:

   - Visit `/basic-fund` to test a minimal FundCard implementation
   - Visit `/simple-fund` to test a FundCard with CDP Project ID handling

4. **Environment Variable Verification**:
   - Both client-side (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`) and server-side variables must be set
   - The CDP Project ID must be set as both `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_PROJECT_ID` (client-side) and `CDP_PROJECT_ID` (server-side)
   - The API route at `/api/auth` must return a valid CDP Project ID
   - Make sure your OnchainKit API Key is set as both `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY` (client-side) and `ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY` (server-side)

### Custom Integration

The Custom Integration demo showcases a fully customizable UI that gives you complete control over the user experience. Recent enhancements include:

- **Expanded Currency Options**: Support for USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, JPY, CHF, SGD
- **Multiple Cryptocurrency Assets**: USDC, ETH, BTC, SOL, MATIC, AVAX, LINK, UNI, AAVE, DAI
- **Diverse Network Support**: Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, BNB Chain
